facile
======

A static and dynamic Content Management System (CMS) written in Perl using the
Mojolicious framework.

Why?
----

Because I couldn't find a CMS that I like that was both facile and capable of
generating static web pages. I couldn't find a CMS that would use PostgreSQL. I
couldn't find a Perl-based CMS that would run on Heroku and by itself.

facile isn't setting out to be something to everyone. It is mostly to satisfy
my desire to use Heroku, and also run a static Web site with another Web host.

And, most importantly, I don't want to force users to learn a different syntax
to generate HTML content. There's already a syntax for that.
