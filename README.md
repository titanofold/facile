facile
======

A static or dynamic Content Management System (CMS) written in Perl using the
Mojolicious framework.

Why?
----

Because I couldn't find a CMS that I like that was both facile and capable of
generating static web pages. I couldn't find a CMS that would use PostgreSQL or
SQLite. I couldn't find a Perl-based CMS that would run on Heroku and by
itself.

facile isn't setting out to be something to everyone. It is mostly to satisfy
my desire to use Heroku, and also run a static Web site with another Web host.
